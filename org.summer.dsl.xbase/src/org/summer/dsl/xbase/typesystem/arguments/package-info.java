/**
 * Encapsulated handling of feature call arguments.
 * 
 * The main purpose of this encapsulation is to allow easier testing and
 * to be able to reorder to-be-computed argument types according to the
 * probability that they can be computed successfully, e.g. lambda 
 * expression should be computed last.
